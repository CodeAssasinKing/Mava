                <h3>AIR CHARTER with MAVA</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>When &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo; is already too late.</strong><br>
                    Sometimes, cargo can&rsquo;t wait.<br>
                    A contract is on the line. Production is stalled. Every hour costs.<br>
                    In those moments, regular logistics isn&rsquo;t enough.<br>
                    But we are.<br>
                    MAVA arranges a charter tailored to your timeline,<br>
                    your route, your urgency.<br>
                    No schedules &mdash; just point of origin and destination.<br>
                    We&rsquo;ll handle the rest.<br>
                    Documents? Permits? Aircraft availability?<br>
                    <strong>We don&rsquo;t just move planes. We move the process.</strong><br>
                    Air Charter isn&rsquo;t just about speed.<br>
                    It&rsquo;s about making sure <strong>your cargo flies exactly when it needs to.</strong><br>
                    Not early. Not late. But right on time.<br>
                    <strong>When time flies &mdash; we fly faster.</strong>

                <h3>Route Survey by MAVA</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Before we move — we know where. And how. Down to the millimeter.</strong><br>
                    A route survey isn’t “let’s go take a look.”<br>
                    It’s data. Precision. Engineering logic.<br>
                    We study the route — not with guesses, but with instruments.<br>
                    Because heavy cargo means serious responsibility.<br>
                    Bridges, tunnels, slopes, road surfaces, curves, utilities —<br>
                    anything that can become a risk becomes part of the plan.<br>
                    We use modern tools:<br>
                    laser rangefinders, digital levels, 3D modeling, advanced geodetic instruments.<br>
                    Need drones? We send them.<br>
                    Need pilot runs and detailed speed calculations? We do it.<br>
                    Every route is broken down into numbers —<br>
                    so that we don’t “fix problems later,”<br>
                    we <strong>avoid them altogether.</strong><br>
                    <strong>With <span style="color:#AD1C42;">MAVA</span>, a route doesn’t just exist.<br>
                    It’s prepared, verified, and ready to deliver.</strong>

                <h3>MAVA Warehousing</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Where cargo rests easy. And you stay in control.</strong><br>
                    600 m<sup>2</sup> of covered storage.<br>
                    100 m<sup>2</sup> of cold storage.<br>
                    Not a single square meter wasted — everything used with purpose.<br>
                    This isn’t just a facility — it’s a buffer that protects your cargo.<br>
                    Consolidation, cross-docking, short-term storage, labeling, prep—we don’t just handle cargo, we manage it.<br>
                    The warehouse is part of the route.<br>
                    Not “wait here,” but “this is part of the plan.”<br>
                    Temperature control, access monitoring, compliance —<br>
                    everything in place, everything on point.<br>
                    And if tomorrow you need 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> — we know where to get it. Fast.<br>
                    <strong>A warehouse isn’t a pause.<br>
                    It’s part of the motion.</strong><br>
                    <strong>With <span style="color:#AD1C42;">MAVA</span> — always one step ahead.</strong>

                <p>
                    <strong>When the method doesn’t matter — only the result does.</strong><br>
                    We don’t choose between sea, road, air, or rail.<br>
                    We combine them — so your cargo moves as one seamless journey.<br>
                    No gaps. No delays. No “sorry, that’s another department.”<br>
                    Multimodal with MAVA means <strong>your entire logistics chain<br>
                    becomes one clear line.</strong><br>
                    No “out of our scope,” no “our job ends at the port,” no “talk to someone else.”<br>
                    We manage the full route — from point A to point Z.<br>
                    Including paperwork, transit zones, reloading, tracking, and timing.<br>
                    You don’t need to understand the complexity behind the scenes.<br>
                    You just need to know: it’s all going according to plan.<br>
                    <strong>With <span style="color:#AD1C42;">MAVA</span>, it doesn’t matter how many modes of transport.<br>
                    What matters is that everything works as one.</strong>

                <p>
                    <strong>When you need not a format. But freedom of route.</strong><br>
                    Schedules don’t fit.<br>
                    The route is too long.<br>
                    The cargo is too large.<br>
                    And the deadlines are too tight.<br>
                    This isn’t about logistics. This is about a challenge.<br>
                    And we have the answer — <strong>a vessel tailored to the task.</strong><br>
                    We don’t just “search the database.”<br>
                    We activate our network, connections, and expertise.<br>
                    Coordinate the port. Coordinate the crew.<br>
                    Coordinate the wind, if needed.<br>
                    While others try to fit your project into their routes —<br>
                    we tailor the route to your project.<br>

                    <strong>
                        When the cargo is non-standard — standard approaches don’t work.
                        <span style="color:#AD1C42;">MAVA</span> knows what it takes.
                    </strong><br>
                    Heavy, oversized, irregular —<br>
                    whatever goes beyond the limits, falls right into our comfort zone.<br>
                    Hundreds of tons. Long overhangs. Complex geometry.<br>
                    This isn’t just about “delivery.” It’s about <strong>planning,<br>
                    approval, foresight — and flawless execution.</strong><br>
                    We calculate axle loads. Check bridges.<br>
                    Measure curves and inclines.<br>
                    We handle permits, escorts, rigging, and special equipment.<br>
                    If needed — we build a route from scratch.<br>
                    If needed — we lift by crane and lower within millimeters.<br>
                    We don’t just transport.<br>
                    We take full responsibility — from factory to foundation.<br>
